# Nexar-Visual-Localization

![triplets](images/triplets.png)

Accurate vehicle localization is a crucial step towards building effective Vehicle-to-Vehicle networks and automotive applications. Here, we publish our dataset for training visual localization model, based on real world data.

## Introduction
This dataset is used in our [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.0000), which appears in the proceedings for CVPR 2019 Workshop on Autonomous Driving. 
We propose a robust visual localization approach for automotive applications.

## Dataset
